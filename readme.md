# TADPMï¼šAutomatic Tooth Arrangement with Joint Features of Point and Mesh Representations via Diffusion Probabilistic Models

This is the PyTorch implementation of our TADPM.

### Requirements

To install python requirements:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install chamfer distance:

```shell
cd chamfer_dist
python setup.py install
```

To install manifold, please refer to https://github.com/ZhaoHengJiang/MeshReconstruction/tree/main/Manifold

### Data pre-process

- To get single tooth mesh files:

```shell
bash scripts/get_mesh.sh
```

- To get pointcloud files:

```shell
bash scripts/get_pointcloud.sh
```

- To get remesh files:

```shell
bash scripts/remesh.sh
```

### Pretrain

- To pretrain MeshMAE:

```shell
bash scripts/pretrain.sh
```

You can also refer to https://github.com/liang3588/MeshMAE

### Train

- To train the TADPM model:

```shell
bash scripts/train.sh
```

When training TADPM, you should set the path to pretrained MeshMAE model checkpoint.

### Test

- To visualize TADPM's results, run:

```
bash scripts/get_result.sh
```
